# 🧠 CONTINUE_LATER.md

This file contains clear next steps to continue building out the `script-generator` project. It assumes that you have already:

- Set up the repo (`script-generator`)
- Installed dependencies in a virtual environment
- Successfully generated scripts and developer instruction files
- Committed & pushed to GitHub

---

## ✅ WHAT'S WORKING

- `generate1.py` now supports **multi-agent flows**:  
  `ScriptGeneratorAgent`, `DevInstructionAgent`, and more.
- Scripts are being generated in `/output/`
- Instructions for developers are saved in `/instructions/`
- Repo is version-controlled and live on GitHub
- YAML index (`config/scripts_index.yaml`) is functioning
- Batch generation from `scripts.csv` works as expected

---

## 🔜 WHAT TO DO NEXT

### 1. 🧪 Add Unit Testing Support
- Auto-generate `tests/test_<script>.py` with `pytest` templates
- Each function should be testable independently
- Add `tests/__init__.py` and configure `pytest.ini`

---

### 2. 🧵 Two-Way Google Sheet Sync
- Add a script that updates the sheet with:
  - ✅ Status of generation
  - 🔗 Link to the script
  - ⏱ Timestamp
- Consider Google Sheets API or Apps Script that calls back to `/status`

---

### 3. 📊 Track Generation in DuckDB
- Set up `/logs/generation_log.duckdb`
- Table structure:
  - `script_name`, `timestamp`, `agent`, `success`, `error_message`
- Log every generation request and result

---

### 4. 🛠 Add New Agents

| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `ScriptRefactorAgent` | Refactor and optimize existing code |
| `WorkflowComposerAgent` | Build full pipelines across categories |
| `MetaAgent` | Detect redundancy & suggest merges |
| `DevInstructionAgent` ✅ | Already included |
| `UnitTestAgent` | Generates `pytest` tests |
| `IOExampleAgent` | Adds I/O examples to generated scripts |
| `CodeReviewAgent` | Reviews & annotates generated code |

### 6. 🔄 General Improvements

- [ ] Add CLI interface (e.g. `python generate.py --script "Zoning Detector"`)
- [ ] Export all generated scripts to a GitHub Pages viewer
- [ ] Add GitHub Action to auto-run new generations on push to `scripts.csv`
- [ ] Integrate VSCode Code Lens or Copilot for editing/follow-up

---

## 🧩 Optional Extras

- 🧠 Integrate with [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) for chaining multi-agent flows
- 🔐 Add API key rotation and usage logging
- 📤 Add webhook or Slack notifications for completion
- 💡 Use a custom GPT with system prompt: “You are the agent for the Exelant Script Platform…”

## 🧭 Suggested Short-Term Goals

| Goal | ETA | Owner |
|------|-----|-------|
| Add 3 more agents | This Week | You |
| Unit test generation | This Week | GPT |
| Workflow Composer MVP | Next Week | You |
| Two-way Sheet Sync | Next Week | You |
| GitHub Pages script browser | Future | Optional |

## ✨ Vision Reminder

> You’re not just generating scripts — you’re building an extensible **geospatial scripting platform** for public interest tech and development. Every script is part of a modular, automatable, transparent, and auditable workflow.
